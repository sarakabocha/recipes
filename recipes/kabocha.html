    <h1>Steamed kabocha</h1>
    <h2>The fact that you don't need a recipe is proof that this squash is perfection. Oh my gourd!</h2>
        <p>Be sure to select a squash that is ripe. It will taste sweet and nutty like roast chestnuts.
            Look for a squash that has a <span class="highlight">burnt orange and brownish color.</span>
            This signals that it will be tasty. Ones with bright splashes of green and yellow aren't ripe.
            The best time to gather squash is during late fall and winter.</p>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Cut the kabocha in half. Remove the seeds.</li>
                <li>Boil water in a pot with a steamer rack.</li>
                <li>Add the squash and let it steam for about 15 minutes, or until a chopstick runs smoothly through.</li>
                <li>Enjoy!</li>
            </ol>
