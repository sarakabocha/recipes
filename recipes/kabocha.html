    <h1>Steamed kabocha</h1>
    <h2>Oh my gourdness! How to savor the best vegetable of all time</h2>
        <p>Be sure to select a squash that is ripe. It will taste sweet and nutty like roast chestnuts.
            Look for a squash that has a burnt orange and brownish color.
            This signals that it will be tasty. Ones with bright splashes of green and yellow aren't ripe.
            The best time to gather squash is during late fall and winter.</p>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Cut the kabocha in half. Remove the seeds.</li>
                <li>Boil water in a pot with a steamer rack.</li>
                <li>Add the squash and let it steam for about 15 minutes, or until a chopstick runs smoothly through.</li>
                <li>Enjoy!</li>
