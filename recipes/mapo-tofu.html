    <h1>Mapo tofu</h1>
    <h2>Based on a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/6a41g8/recipe_authentic_sichuan_mapo_tofu_麻婆豆腐/">reddit</a> recipe.</h2>
    <h3>Basic Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>230 g Soft tofu (嫩豆腐). Aim for the proper 'soft tofu' but slightly too firm is better than slightly too soft.</li>
        <li>½ tbsp Sichuan peppercorns (花椒)</li>
        <li>35 g Minced pork</li>
        <li>2-3 Garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>1½ tbsp Sichuan chili bean paste (川式豆瓣酱) Minced to break down any bean chunks. A super critical ingredient - this is going to form the base for our sauce.</li>
        <li>0.25 to 2 tsp Chili/cayenne pepper powder</li>
        <li>¾ cup ”Stock” Standard stock-plus-concentrate mixture here, would use 1 tsp of concentrate</li>
        <li>Canola oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Other Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tsp Shaoxin rice wine</li>
        <li>1 tsp Light Soy Sauce (生抽)</li>
        <li>1 tsp Sugar</li>
        <li>½ tsp Dark chinese vinegar (陈醋), added near the end of cooking</li>
        <li>1 tsp Cornstarch. Slurry of 1 tsp cornstarch and a tbsp of water.</li>
        <li>1 tsp Sesame oil to finish</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Toast and grind the Sichuan peppercorns on medium-low heat for a couple minutes (dry pan). You’ll know it’s done once the Sichuan peppercorns are aromatic and leave little oil specks in the wok. Grind those up in a morter-and-pestle.</li>
        <li>Cut and simmer the tofu. Cut your tofu into small cubes, about a half inch. Then toss your tofu cubes in a pot of salted water (we used 2 tsp of salt in that smaller pot) that’s barely simmering.</li>
        <li>Fry the mince.</li>
        <li>Fry the chili bean paste</li>
        <li>Fry minced garlic and chili powder. Add these ingredients and fry it for about a minute.</li>
        <li>Add the stock, season, and start to simmer. Add stock, the soy sauce, the Shaoxing cooking wine (料酒), and the sugar. It should taste slightly undersalted. Let it simmer for a couple minutes.</li>
        <li>Drain the tofu, then add it to the pot</li>
        <li>Let the tofu simmer in the liquid as it’s reducing. Bring the heat back up to medium-high to get a hefty simmer going on (basically a small boil). Stir gently. At about the 3 minute mark, the liquid should start to be boiling away rapidly and starting to resemble a thin sauce</li>
        <li>Season the sauce, then thicken it up with the slurry. Add the toasted-and-ground Sichuan peppercorns. If you do it too early you’ll end up with this brackish-black colored sauce instead of the desired red-oil. Add in the half teaspoon of dark vinegar, stir and cook for about 30 seconds. Add cornstarch slurry to thicken, and turn off the heat.</li>
        <li>Stir in sesame oil, then plate with green onion.</li>
    </ol>
